# SESYNC_MPA_Global
A repository for the files and code associated with part 1 of the Ch-Ch-Changes MPA project. 

Very basic outline: 
1) Calculate the proportion of each cell that is within an MPA. This will be used to modify fishing effort within the cell as an input into the DBEM model. 
2) Re-run DBEM model with adjusted fishing effort for no-take MPAs.
3) Re-run DBEM model with adjusted fishing effort for all MPAs (Hypothetical scenario: if all MPAs were turned into no-take MPAs). 
4) Compare values from both MPA outputs to the base case model (Climate change under RCP 2.6 and 8.5)
